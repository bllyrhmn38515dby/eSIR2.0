# User Management Fixes Summary

## 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Form Modal Component
**Problem**: The UserManagement component had `setShowForm` state but no actual form modal was rendered when `showForm` was true.

**Solution**: 
- Added complete form modal component with all necessary fields
- Fixed the `showForm` state declaration (was using `[, setShowForm]`)
- Added proper form structure with validation

### 2. Disabled handleInputChange Function
**Problem**: The `handleInputChange` function was commented out with eslint-disable.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the eslint-disable comment
- Function now properly updates form data state

### 3. Missing CSS Styles
**Problem**: CSS file had styles for `.form-overlay` but component was using `.form-modal`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated CSS to use correct class names
- Added missing styles for form elements, buttons, and layout
- Added proper modal overlay and content styles

### 4. Incorrect Role Options
**Problem**: Frontend was using "operator" role which doesn't exist in the database.

**Solution**: 
- Updated role options to use available roles: `admin_pusat`, `admin_faskes`, `sopir_ambulans`
- Updated role badge function to handle `sopir_ambulans` role
- Added proper CSS styling for the new role badge

### 5. Missing Stats Card Update
**Problem**: Stats card was still showing "Operator" instead of "Sopir Ambulans".

**Solution**: 
- Updated stats card to show "Sopir Ambulans" with ambulance emoji
- Fixed the filter to count `sopir_ambulans` users
